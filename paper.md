:::{attention} Enable Computational Interactivity 

**<span style="color:red">To enable interactivity, attach a runtime by clicking the `⏻` icon in the top-right corner of the figure 2 panel</span>**. If no runtime is attached, the figure will remain in its default state: hover and basic interactions are available.

**<span style="color:red">Once loaded, three buttons appear in the corner. Click the middle play button `▶️` to activate figure 2.</span>** When the static figure is replaced by an interactive Plotly chart, use the toggles to modify the display. Use `↩` to revert to the original static figure.
