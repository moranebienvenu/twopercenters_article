:::{attention} Enable Computational Interactivity 

**<span style="color:red">To enable interactivity, attach a runtime by clicking the `⏻` icon in the top-right corner of the figure 2 panel</span>**. If no runtime is attached, the figure will remain in its default state: hover and basic interactions are available.

**<span style="color:red">Once loaded, three buttons appear in the corner. Click the middle play button `▶️` to activate figure 2.</span>** When the static figure is replaced by an interactive Plotly chart, use the toggles to modify the display. Use `↩` to revert to the original static figure.

:::{figure} #fig2cell
:label: fig2
:name: individual_gauge
:placeholder: ./static/fig2.png

Individual researcher performance panel showing example bibliometric analysis for John P.A. Ioannidis. (a) Summary metrics panel displaying composite score (5.19) and key bibliometric indicators including total citations (88.6K), H-index (132), and HM-index (66.9), with corresponding percentile rankings and citation distributions across single-authored and collaborative works.
***Users can enter another author’s name (a minimum of three letters is required), and a list of available authors will be shown. Users can also select the type of analysis (Career or Single Year), choose the year (2017–2021), set limits (by country, field, or institute), and toggle the exclusion of self-citations.***
